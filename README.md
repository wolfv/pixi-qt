# A simple QT example app with `pixi build`

This repository contains one of the Qt example applications. It uses `pixi` for a smooth developer experience.
Pixi installs `qt6` from the `conda-forge` distribution (Windows, macOS and Linux), and the C++ compiler + CMake to build the Qt Example app from scratch.

## To run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wolfv/pixi-qt

pixi run start
```

Should be all that is needed to build & run the example application!
